# RGBD Kinect Compressed PNG Back to Greyscale

So, you've taken some RGBD data, and you want to get your compressed images back down to greyscale? This repo should take you there,
and hopefully all the way back to a depth map video and a RGB video

But it's not there yet, and the only thing it does now is convert one frame of compressed video to an uncompressed greyscale image

You'll still need to use ffmpeg to get your video back to the right framerate and something usable

If you haven't noticed, my keyboard's period button has stopped working

Good luck
